A metal rack for shipping purposes is designed and structural integrity is evaluated by structural simulation.

Notes: 
1. Extract zip files inside the folder "Simulation Files" using Winrar to make "Stand sim_3.5g along x 16-11-22.wbpz" file.
2. CAD files and Simulation files requires minimum SolidWorks 2022 and Ansys 2020 R1.
